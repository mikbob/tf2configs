# tf2configs
This is for anyone who needs better performance in tf2. Take the maxframes config and add it as a your tf2 autoexec. It is highly modular so you can comment out anything you want and it should still work.

Most of the stuff is currently from tf2configs/tf2configs however I plan to keep it up to date with some new stuff.
